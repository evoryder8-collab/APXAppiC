## Seeded at handoff — 2026-08-22

**Branch:** `codex/main-critical-repair` · **HEAD:** `c1b0e77` · 7 commits ahead of `main`.

**Landed:**
- `9f6c34e` sync hardening — meal-kind normalisation, settings rebound to authenticated user,
  4xx quarantined instead of jamming the offline queue
- `d92a591` meal-edit fix — `clientIdempotencyKey` now computed, differs on reopen, plus
  `replaceMealID`, so edits are no longer swallowed by the RPC short-circuit
- `fb29aee` dayline duplicate time labels removed
- `0306f5a`, `21e9504` docs — beta access and StoreKit plan (`docs/plans/`)
- `130d861` workout receipt preserved, UI coverage
- `c1b0e77` rest-day truth — `SessionBriefing`, `TrainingPlanEngine`, `MuscleMapView`,
  `TrainingProgramView` + parity tests

**Uncommitted, in progress — finish, do not restart:**
- `ios/APEXNative/APEX/Core/Engine/ManualWorkout.swift` — `var rir: Int?` on `SetDraft`, clamped 0–5
- `ios/APEXNative/APEX/Core/Models/APEXModels.swift` — `enum WorkoutSessionMode` with
  `resolve(lastUsed:dayDefault:)`, `sessionMode` mapped to `session_mode`
- `ios/APEXNative/APEXTests/ManualAndInductionTests.swift` — tests for both

**Verified still broken at handoff:**
- RIR fabricated at both capture points: `TrainingProgramView.swift:1424`
  (`rir: skipped ? nil : 2`) and `AppSession.swift:1605` (`rir: 2`)
- `session_mode` referenced in exactly one Swift file (the model). Nothing reads it.
- No `"skip"` string anywhere in `Features/Onboarding`
- `TrainingInductionPanel` gated on `newbie_mode`, so it hides from the advanced users who need it
- Web `21000` (supplements) and `23503` (`food_preferences`) firing in production
- Test meal "Codex server signoff" still in the Breakfast slot of the live account

**Traps — do not rediscover these the hard way:**
- `log_structured_meal` (migration 009) is CREATE-ONLY. It short-circuits on a known
  `client_idempotency_key` and returns before any replace or insert.
- `SyncFailurePolicy` treats all 4xx as permanent except 408/425/429, so a **401 from an expired
  JWT quarantines and discards the write**. 401 should refresh and retry.
- `LazyVStack` has bitten this codebase twice: on the training month grid and on the nutrition page,
  a lazy stack never materialised the cards below the fold, so content was literally unreachable by
  scrolling. Both were fixed by making those stacks eager. Check this before adding a third.
- Cancelled tasks were surfacing `Swift.CancellationError` to users as an alarming error. Cancel
  stale work deliberately, but never show that error.

**Trial: DECIDED, do not re-ask.** No free trial during beta. `Entitlement.trialDays` and the
"7 days free" paywall copy are stale and must be removed. Hard gate immediately after sign-up;
only founding accounts, a redeemed beta code, or a verified StoreKit entitlement pass.

**Entitlement is device-wide today — that is a security defect.** A redeemed code currently unlocks
the device, not the account, so one family member's code can unlock a different account on the same
iPhone. Make it account-scoped and server-authoritative.

**Six audit fixes are stranded on frozen `909cd63`** and are NOT on this branch: realtime filtering,
web supplement dedup, food_preferences repair, `020_restrict_rls_auto_enable.sql`, and two Orbit
items. See the STRANDED WORK table in docs/ROADMAP.md. Port from that commit, do not rewrite.

**Next:** Phase 1.1 — honest RIR.
